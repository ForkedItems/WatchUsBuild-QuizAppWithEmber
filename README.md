# Design Mockups

This repository contains the design mockups for the Try Ember Soup to Bits
video.

## Usage

You may open the local HTML files directly in a browser or use a simple HTTP
server to host these files and make them more easily navigable.

If you have Python installed, for example, you can use the SimpleHTTPServer by
running `python -m SimpleHTTPServer` in the root directory of this repository:

```
$ python -m SimpleHTTPServer
Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 8000 ...
```

Once it's running, open a browser and navigate to
[http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/).
